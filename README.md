# MUSISM  MUSI by ISM
Musism is a simple music playback app inspired by Musi, which allows you to download YouTube videos and listen to them on your PC. That's it.

You can also playback local mp3 files by dragging them into the Downloads folder.

# Installation

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/prod-ism/MUSISM/releases) Setup.exe and run.

To search up youtube videos, you need a **YouTube V3 API Key**, Figure out how to get one here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started

I don't know if theres mac/linux support because this was only tested on windows
