# MUSISM  MUSI by ISM
Musism is a simple music playback app inspired by Musi, which allows you to download YouTube videos and listen to them on your PC. That's it.

To search up youtube videos, you need a **YouTube V3 API Key**, Figure out how to get one here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
